## Description

Implement the policy resolution engine that determines the applicable policy for a user/category combination. This includes implementing the precedence rules (user-specific > organization-wide) and creating an API endpoint for debugging policy resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System determines applicable policy for user/category combination
- [ ] Clear precedence rules implemented (user-specific > organization-wide)
- [ ] Policy debugging tool for transparency
- [ ] All operations are tested with unit and integration tests
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (<500ms resolution time)

## TODOs

- [ ] Design policy resolution algorithm with precedence rules
- [ ] Implement policy resolution engine service
- [ ] Write unit tests for policy resolution engine
- [ ] Create API endpoint to test/debug policy resolution
- [ ] Optimize performance for policy resolution

## Progress Updates

### 2025-09-20 - Initial Creation
**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: Task created
**Blockers**: None
**Next Steps**: Begin algorithm design

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Code review completed

## Notes

The policy resolution engine is a critical component that determines how expenses are processed. It must be efficient and accurate.
