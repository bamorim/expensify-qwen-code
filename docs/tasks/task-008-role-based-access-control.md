  - TASK-002 (User Invitations)

## Description

Implement role-based access control checks to distinguish between Admin (policy management) and Member (expense submission) roles. This includes implementing helper functions to check roles, adding role-based guards to all tRPC procedures, and updating the UI to show/hide features based on user roles.

The role model is already defined in the database schema from Task 1, where the organization creator becomes an admin automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Helper functions to check if user is admin or member of an organization
- [ ] Role-based guards on all tRPC procedures
- [ ] UI properly shows/hides features based on user roles
- [ ] All operations are tested with unit and integration tests

## TODOs

- [ ] Implement helper functions to check user roles
- [ ] Add role-based guards to all tRPC procedures
- [ ] Write tests for role-based access control
- [ ] Update UI to show/hide features based on user roles

## Progress Updates

### 2025-09-20 - Initial Creation
**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: Task created
**Blockers**: None
**Next Steps**: Begin implementing helper functions

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Code review completed

## Notes

This task focuses on implementing the access control checks, not the database schema which was already defined in Task 1. We're using helper functions rather than middleware for better type safety and simplicity.
