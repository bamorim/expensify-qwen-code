## Description

Replace the placeholder "Posts" functionality with Organization management. This includes creating a database schema for organizations, implementing tRPC procedures for organization management (create, read, update, delete), and creating the UI for organization management.

This is the foundational feature that all other features depend on, as expenses, policies, and categories all belong to organizations.

The database schema should include a role system with Member and Admin roles, and the organization creator should automatically be set as an Admin of the organization they create. This prepares the system for future role-based access control implementation.
