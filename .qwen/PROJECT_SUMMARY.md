# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Build an expense management application for companies with core features including organization management, user invitations, role-based access control, expense categories, policy management, and expense submission/review workflows.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: T3 Stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, tRPC, NextAuth) with Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Magic code email-based authentication with NextAuth
- **Architecture**: Multi-tenant design with organizations as the primary scoping mechanism
- **Role System**: Two roles (ADMIN/MEMBER) with ADMINs having policy management privileges and MEMBERS having expense submission privileges
- **Testing**: Vitest with transactional testing using `@chax-at/transactional-prisma-testing`
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier with strict TypeScript checking
- **Build Commands**: 
  - `pnpm dev` - Development server
  - `pnpm build` - Production build
  - `pnpm check` - Linting and type checking
  - `pnpm test` - Run tests
